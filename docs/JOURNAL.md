# napflow — Working journal

Newest first. One short entry per working session / milestone:
**done / decided / next**, 2–5 lines each. This is the cross-session
progress log — keep it lean; details live in specs, DECISIONS, and git.

## 2026-07-04 — Session tooling

- Done: SessionEnd breadcrumb hook (`.claude/hooks/session-end-log.sh` →
  gitignored `.claude/sessions.log`), project `.claude/settings.json`,
  initial `.gitignore`; S1 milestones mirrored into the native task list.
- Decided: Typer stays as the CLI library (Typer wraps click so its
  ecosystem comes along; tyro's config-object model doesn't fit a
  command-tree CLI like `napf`).
- Next: S1/M0 repo scaffolding.

## 2026-07-02 — Documentation phase closed

- Done: full doc set adopted and internally consistent — specs
  (flow-schema v0.4, engine v0.2, manifest v0.3), D01–D25, EC01–EC37,
  PRODUCT, REQUIREMENTS, yaml-profile, PLAN; five commits on `main`.
- Decided: tech stack stays as-is (niquests/BlackSheep, with adapter
  seam + compat CI as insurance); endpoint collections and
  Postman/OpenAPI import parked for v2; tooling = native tasks +
  built-in memory + git-cliff changelog at M0.
- Next: S1/M0 — repo scaffolding (pyproject, CI matrix, import-linter,
  changelog toolchain).
